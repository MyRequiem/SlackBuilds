Here's how to install Opera-next Browser on Slackware.

First, go to
http://www.opera.com/browser/
and download the .deb package opera version 26+

Then, with the Opera .deb package in the same directory
as the opera-next.SlackBuild script, run the script as
root to convert the .deb to a Slackware .txz:

./opera-next.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.
You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.
