Here's how to install Yandex Browser on Slackware.

First, go to http://browser.yandex.ru/

Click the download button. Currently only available beta version x86_64.
Download the .deb package.

Then, with the Yandex.deb package in the same directory
as the yandex-browser.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to
convert the .deb to a Slackware .txz:

./yandex-browser.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.
You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.
